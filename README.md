CS-255 System Analysis and Design - Journal

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    The goal of the DriverPass project was to design a system that provided users with a seamless way to reserve driving classes and take practice tests in order to have a better chance at passing their driving test. This   
    was driven by the understanding that many individuals have to retake their driving test multiple times at the DMV. The client for this project was a company called DriverPass, owned by Liam. The system I designed allows 
    users to register an account on the DriverPass site, log in, take practice tests, reserve driving classes, and modify or cancel any preexisting reservations.

2. What did you do particularly well?
    With regard to my designs, I believe I excelled in understanding and translating the desires of the client into actionable requirements for the system. The UML diagrams I created provide a clear visual representation of 
    the system I had in mind and ensure both the DriverPass client and development team can fully understand the expected functionalities of the end product.  

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    If I could choose one part of the project to revise, it would be the use case diagram. One aspect that I wanted to account for was an instructor user. An instructor would be able to pick which classes they would like to 
    teach and would be assigned to user reservations as the classes are scheduled. The instructor would also be able to specify their available days, their available times, and the maximum number of students they wish to be 
    assigned at any given time. This added user would be easy to implement, and its addition would only require some minor modifications to the current design. These would include allowing individual reservations to have an 
    instructor assigned to them and changing how reservation conflicts are checked by also accounting for the instructor and their availability. 

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    The interpretation of the user's needs was derived from the transcript of the interview with the DriverPass owner, Liam, and the team. We took his desires for what he wanted the system to provide for users and 
    translated that into use cases, which accounted for the major functionalities within the DriverPass system. When designing a system, it is important to consider the user's needs because the system is only as good as it 
    is relevant and usable for the intended audience. By addressing user needs with representations like use cases, the team can ensure that not only is the system functional but also efficient in in achieving its stated 
    goals. 

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    When creating my designs, my first step was to create a business requirements document derived from the DriverPass interview. From there, I translated the major functionalities of the proposed system into use cases. 
    Following that, I created activity diagrams and a sequence diagram detailing how the major use cases should function. I also created a class diagram to visually represent the framework of the system. In the future, I 
    plan on utilizing similar techniques to what I described, as I believe it created a relatively thorough and clear starting point to begin the hands-on development of a new system. In addition to that, I would increase 
    the number of activity and sequence diagrams I create to better represent and plan out every use case.
